Smart Student Platform ‚Äì User Manual

1. Introduction

Smart Student Platform is a Java Swing desktop application for managing student records and academic results.
It allows administrators to add/update student details, search and sort records, and compute class performance statistics.

2. System Requirements

Java JDK 8+ installed on your system

Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS

A desktop environment (Swing requires a GUI, not headless server)

3. Installation

Download or clone the project from the repository.

git clone https://github.com/xamvi12/capstone-project.io.git

Change Directory:
cd capstone-project.io

Compile the Code
javac -d . *.java

Package into a JAR
jar cfe SmartStudentPlatform.jar 
capstone.core.CapstoneCore capstone/core/*.class

Run the Application
java -jar SmartStudentPlatform.jar
üëâ The Swing GUI will open.

So I created a **helper script run.sh**
sudo nano run.sh

Ensure run.sh is executable:

chmod +x run.sh

4. Running the Application

Compile and run everything in one step:

./run.sh all


Run using the JAR (after building):

java -jar SmartStudentPlatform.jar

5) How to use the app 

Add or update a student: enter ID and Name at the top, click ‚ÄúAdd/Update Student‚Äù.

Add a course result to a selected student:

Click the student row in the table.

Fill Course Code, Title, Units (number), and Score (0‚Äì100), click ‚ÄúAdd Result‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Sort:

Choose ‚ÄúSort by Name (QuickSort)‚Äù or ‚ÄúSort by CGPA (Bubble Sort)‚Äù in the dropdown.

Search:

Type an ID in ‚ÄúSearch by ID‚Äù, click ‚ÄúLinear Search‚Äù or ‚ÄúBinary Search‚Äù.

Summaries:

The bar at the bottom shows Class Average CGPA and Top Performer.

Save/Load:

Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù to write all data to a file, ‚ÄúLoad‚Äù to restore from a file.

Errors:

If you enter text for a number, or leave fields empty, you‚Äôll see a clear error popup (JOptionPane).

6) How this meets the rubric and requirements

Object-Oriented Programming

Classes: Student, Course, Result. Encapsulation via private fields + getters/setters. Abstraction via Identifiable interface and StudentManager facade for data operations.

Overloading/Overriding: Result.setScore recalculates grade/points; toString overridden in Student.

Collections & Algorithms

Data structures: ArrayList (ordered list), HashMap (fast lookup by ID) used in StudentManager.

Sorting: QuickSort by name (custom), Bubble Sort by CGPA (custom).

Searching: Linear search and Binary search by ID (binary uses a sorted copy).

GUI & Event Handling (Swing)

Components: JFrame, JTable, JTextField, JComboBox, JButton, JOptionPane.

Listeners: ActionListener on buttons, ItemListener on the sort dropdown.

Display: JTable via a custom AbstractTableModel.

Exception Handling

try/catch around numeric parsing, empty fields, invalid ranges, and file I/O.

Error feedback with JOptionPane messages.

Save/Load

Simple Java serialization of StudentManager to a file (and back).
